## Requirements

### 1. **HTML: Structure Your Page**

Use HTML to lay out the core sections of your portfolio. Follow these guidelines:

- **Semantic HTML**: Ensure you're using appropriate and semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<ul>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`. This improves both accessibility and SEO.
  - Example elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` instead of generic `<div>` tags.
  
- **Content Sections**:
  - **Header**: Include your name and navigation links.
  - **About Me**: A brief introduction about yourself.
  - **Projects**: Showcase at least 2-3 of your past projects with descriptions and links (optional).
  - **Contact Information**: A section with your contact details such as email or social media.

### 2. **CSS: Style Your Page**

Apply CSS to make the portfolio visually engaging and easy to navigate.

- **Class and ID Naming**: Use meaningful and descriptive names for your CSS classes and IDs (e.g., `.navbar`, `.projects-section`, `.contact-info`).
- **Design & Layout**:
  - Implement consistent styles for colors, fonts, and layouts.
  - Use spacing techniques such as `margin`, `padding`, and `box-sizing`.
  - Add simple hover effects for buttons and links to enhance user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: (Optional but encouraged) Use media queries to ensure the portfolio looks good on various screen sizes.
