# Portfolio Reverse Engineering Task

## Overview

Welcome to HYF-BE! Your first assignment is to **reverse-engineer** and rebuild a personal **portfolio website** using only **HTML** and **CSS**. This exercise will help you understand the structure of a webpage and recreate it from scratch while allowing room for your own creativity.

### What is a Portfolio?

A **portfolio** is a personalized website that showcases your skills, projects, and experience. For developers, it's an essential tool to demonstrate expertise and creativity to potential employers or clients. In this assignment, you'll rebuild an example portfolio to strengthen your HTML and CSS skills.

Hereâ€™s the portfolio you will reverse-engineer: [Portfolio](https://mileenka.github.io/Portfolio/index.html#about).

## Requirements

### 1. **HTML: Structure Your Page**

Use HTML to lay out the key sections of your portfolio, adhering to these guidelines:

- **Semantic HTML**: Employ appropriate and meaningful tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. Avoid overuse of generic `<div>` tagsâ€”semantic tags improve accessibility and SEO.
  - Example elements to use: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.
  
- **Content Sections**:
  - **Header**: Include your name and navigation links.
  - **About Me**: A short description of who you are.
  - **Projects**: Highlight at least 2-3 past projects with descriptions and optional links.
  - **Contact**: Add your contact details such as email or social media links.

### 2. **CSS: Style Your Page**

Use CSS to make the portfolio visually appealing and easy to navigate.

- **Class and ID Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your CSS classes and IDs (e.g., `.navbar`, `.projects-section`, `.contact-info`).
- **Design & Layout**:
  - Maintain consistent colors, fonts, and layout styles across the portfolio.
  - Leverage **spacing** techniques such as `margin`, `padding`, and `box-sizing` for a clean look.
  - Incorporate simple hover effects for buttons and links to enhance user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: (Optional but encouraged) Use media queries to ensure your portfolio looks good on various screen sizes.
